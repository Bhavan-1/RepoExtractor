**Instructions**

- Ensure .NET framework 4.5 or newer is installed. Then extract the .zip file download to a place on your computer. Right click on all the extracted files and select properties. Make sure to select "unblock" if the option is available.
- You *MUST* make this change to the local security policy to ensure ip addresses show up: 
Change Local Security Policy -> Local Policies -> Audit Policy and turn failure logging on for "audit account logon events" and "audit logon events".
From an admin command prompt: auditpol /set /category:"Logon/Logoff" /success:enable /failure:enable
- To run as a Windows service run "sc create IPBAN type= own start= auto binPath= c:\path\to\service\ipban.exe DisplayName= IPBAN". The service needs file system, event viewer and firewall access, so please run as SYSTEM to ensure permissions.
- Make sure to look at the config file for configuration options.
- To run as a console app, simply run IPBAN.EXE and watch console output.
- If you want to run and debug code in Visual Studio, make sure to run Visual Studio as administrator.
- Here is a regex that matches any 32 bit ip address, useful if you need to add a new block option in the config file: 
(?<ipaddress>^(([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\.){3}([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])$)

**About Me**

I'm Jeff Johnson and I created IPBan to block hackers out because Windows does a horrible job of this by default and performance suffers as hackers try to breach your remote desktop. IPBan gets them in the block rule of the firewall where they belong.

I do consulting and contracting if you need extra customizations for this software.

Donations are accepted, any amount is appreciated, I work on this project for free to benefit the world.
