[Helio Workstation](https://helio.fm) is free and open-source music sequencer, designed to be used on all major platforms.

### Why another sequencer?

Most of the DAW interfaces often seem [overcomplicated](http://mashable.com/2015/09/18/german-u-boat/), and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a tool that **feels right**.

It aims to be a modern music creation software, featuring linear-based sequencer with a clean interface, high-performance C++ core, integrated version control providing intelligent synchronization between devices, saved undo history, translations to many languages and more.

#### Basic build instructions

 * Git clone,
 * Get submodules, if not yet done: `git submodule update --init`,
 * Get VST and ASIO SDKs (which can't be redistributed in this project due to licensing restrictions, but you may use `ThirdParty/get_asio_and_vst_sdks.sh` script to download and extract the SDKs sources if they're not found), you may skip this step for macOS and iOS projects, as the download script will be invoked automatically in the pre-build phase,
 * On Linux, you'll need to have the following packages installed: `libfreetype6-dev libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxcomposite-dev mesa-common-dev freeglut3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev libc++-dev`; the makefile assumes you've set up either `export CONFIG=Debug`, `export CONFIG=Release32` or `export CONFIG=Release64` before you `make`,
 * Pick the right project for your OS from `Projects` directory and build.
