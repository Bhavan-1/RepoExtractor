# TeXstudio [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/texstudio-org/texstudio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/texstudio-org/texstudio)


TeXstudio is a fully featured LaTeX editor. Our goal is to make writing LaTeX documents as easy and comfortable as possible. Some of the outstanding features of TeXstudio are an integrated pdf viewer with (almost) word-level synchronization, live inline preview, advanced syntax-highlighting, live checking of references, citations, latex commands, spelling and grammar. Find out more at our website.

## Features

Generate blocks of code using assistants without the need for detailed LaTeX knowledge.

* Drag & drop support for images 

When you drag an image on the editor the image assistant opens. From there it's just one more click to have the code for the image inclusion. Of course, we try to make the paths relative. This also works with multiple images.

The table-autoformatter aligns the table code.
