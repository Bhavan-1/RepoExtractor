Gosl is a [Go](https://golang.org) library to develop Artificial Intelligence and High-Performance
Scientific Computations.

</div>

The library tries to be as general and _easy_ as possible. Gosl considers the use of both Go
concurrency routines and parallel computing using the message passing interface (MPI). Gosl has
several modules (sub-packages) for a variety of tasks in scientific computing, image analysis, and
data post-processing.

Gosl includes high-performant linear algebra functions (wrapping MKL, OpenBLAS, LAPACK, SuiteSparse,
UMFPACK...), fast Fourier transform algorithms (wrapping FFTW), numerical integration (wrapping
QUADPACK), functions and structures for geometry calculations (e.g. 3D transfinite interpolation,
grid search, octree...), random numbers generation (SFMT and DSFMT) and probability distributions,
optimisation and graph algorithms, plotting and visualisation using the VTK, and much more.

Gosl has also solvers to (stiff or not) ordinary differential equations and several tools for 2D/3D
mesh generation to assist on the development of solvers for partial differential equations.

We now give focus to Machine Learning (see `ml` package) and Big Data (see `h5` package). We are
also planning wrappers to powerful tools such as CNTK, TensorFlow, and Hadoop. We have a wrapper to
OpenCV in the works as well.

## About the filenames

1. `t_something_test.go` is a **unit test**. We have several of them! Some usage
   information can be learned from these files.
2. `t_something_main.go` is a test with a main function to be run with `go run ...` or `mpirun -np ? go
   run ...` (replace ? with the number of cpus).
3. `t_b_something_test.go` is a benchmark test. Run benchmarks with `go test -run=XXX -bench=.`



## Design strategies

Here, we call _structure_ any _user-defined type_. These are simply Go `types` defined as `struct`.
One may think of these _structures_ as _classes_. Gosl has several global functions as well and
tries to avoid complicated constructions.

An allocated structure (instance) is called an **object** and functions attached to this object are
called **methods**. In Gosl, the variable holding the pointer to an object is always named **o**
(lower case "o"). This variable is similar to the `self` or `this` keywords in other languages
(Python, C++, respectively).

Functions that allocate a pointer to a structure are prefixed with `New`; for instance:
`NewIsoSurf`. Some structures require an explicit call to another function to release allocated
memory. Be aware of this requirement! In this case, the function is named `Free` and appears in a
few sub-packages that use CGO. Also, some objects may need to be initialized before use. In this
case, functions named `Init` have to be called.

The directories corresponding to each package have a README.md file that should help with
understanding the library. Also, there are links to `godoc.org` where all functions, structures, and
variables are well explained.



## Test coverage

We aim for a 100% test coverage! Despite trying our best to accomplish this goal, full coverage is
difficult, in particular with (sub)packages that involve `Panic` or `figure generation`.
Nonetheless, critical algorithms are completely tested.

We use the following `bash` macro frequently to check our test coverage:

```bash
gocov() {
    go test -coverprofile=/tmp/cv.out
    go tool cover -html=/tmp/cv.out
}
```
