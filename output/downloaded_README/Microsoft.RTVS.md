# R Tools for Visual Studio

THANK YOU for checking out this early version of R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS). We've decided to make it available
early, so that we'll have more time to address your feedback. As such, there are bugs and missing features, so please
beware! This release is meant for evaluation purposes only, and not for production use.

### Installation

Latests RTVS ships with Visual Studio 2017 as part of the Data Science workload.
You can either install release from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ or
Preview from the https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/. Preview channel has the latest RTVS.

You can still use older extension with VS 2015 Update 3 but it is no longer being updated. 
You can install it from https://aka.ms/rtvs-current

### Documentation

The interim docs are available here:
* [RTVS Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/)

### Bugs and feature requests

Please file bugs and feature requests here on GitHub. Check if the same bug or feature request has already been
made by using search, and if so, then upvote it by
[adding a "thumbs up" reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
to it. Feel free to comment on any existing issues and feature requests with any additional feedback, clarifications,
or questions.

You can also submit feedback via VS 2017 feedback tool.

When filing a bug, you can also use the **R Tools | Send Feedback | Send Frown** feature to send us the product
logs to help us diagnose the problem better. This command will launch your email client with a prepopulated message,
and will gather the logs and highlight them in Windows Explorer, so that they can be conveniently attached to the
email. Please *do not* attach these logs to your GitHub issues, since attachments on issues are visible by everyone,
and the logs may contain private information.

If you need to reach the team directly, email us at rtvsuserfeedback@microsoft.com.

### Roadmap

If you install [ZenHub](https://github.com/marketplace/zenhub) extension for Chrome, 
you should be able to see our milestones, releases and the overall progress.

### Builds and pull requests

If you would like to build RTVS yourself, and maybe even make a pull request (highly appreciated!), please take
a look at the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

### Miscellaneous
