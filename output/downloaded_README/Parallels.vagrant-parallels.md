This is a plugin for [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com),
allowing to manage [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) 
virtual machines on OS X hosts.

### Requirements 
- [Vagrant v1.8](http://www.vagrantup.com) or higher 
(_there are known issues with Vagrant v1.9.5 
[[GH-297](https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/issues/297#issuecomment-304458691)] 
and v1.9.6 [[GH-301]](https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/issues/301)_)
- [Parallels Desktop 10 for Mac](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) or higher

*Note:* Only **Pro** and **Business** editions of **Parallels Desktop for Mac** 
are compatible with this Vagrant provider. 
Standard edition doesn't have a command line functionality and can not be used 
with Vagrant.

## Features
The Parallels provider supports all basic Vagrant features, including shared folders,
private and public networks, forwarded ports and so on. 

If you're just getting started with Vagrant, it is highly recommended that you
read the official [Vagrant documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/) first.

## Installation
First, make sure that you have [Parallels Desktop for Mac](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/)
and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) properly installed.
We recommend that you use the latest versions of these products.

Since the Parallels provider is a Vagrant plugin, installing it is easy:

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels
```
