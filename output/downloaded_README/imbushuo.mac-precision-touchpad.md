# Windows Precision Touchpad Implementation for Apple MacBook family/Magic Trackpad 2

[![Build Status](https://ligstd.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/7694e0d0-94e3-4fd2-b39a-ecd261e1ba2e/22/badge)](https://ptp-release.imbushuo.net/)

**Warning: The project is under development, with some features incomplete yet.** See projects page for known issues and WIP(work-in-progress) items before opening a new issue.

This project aims to implement Windows Precision Touchpad Protocol for Apple MacBook family/Magic Trackpad 2 on Windows 10.

## Installation

1. Go to the release tab in Github and download the newest version
2. Open the zip and navigate to `Drivers\x64\ReleaseSigned`
3. Install `AmtPtpDevice.cer` certificate to your machine's root authority store
4. Go to `AmtPtpDevice` directory
5. Right click `AmtPtpDevice.inf` and install it 

You don't have to enable manual trust, as recent builds are cross-signed by DigiCert.
If you want to try latest changes, you can click "Build Status" badge and download CI builds (tagged with commit ID and machine architecture) manually.

## For developers

It is a user-mode driver, using UMDF Framework v2.15. Windows 10 Driver Development Kit (at least Creators Update version) is required for development and testing.

## Device support

There is a bring-up issue for certain MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. I am looking into it. If you have such device with Windows installed, please contact me so I can look into the issue remotely (as I don't have many devices).

- [x] Non-Retina MacBook 
- [x] Some non-Retina MacBook Pro (2011 and 2012)
- [x] MacBook Pro with Retina Display (MacBookPro 10,1, MacBookPro10,2 & MacBookPro11,1)
- [x] All recent MacBook Air (Please report if your model is not supported)

- [ ] _(Work in progress)_ MacBook Pro with Retina Display (2014, 2015)
- [ ] _(Work in progress)_ MacBook Pro 2015, 2016, 2017

## Roadmap

- [x] Touchpad Device Power Management
- [x] Touchpad Protocol Stack Implementation
- [x] Touchpad Raw Input Output (in Driver Trace)
- [x] HID Protocol Implementation (PTP Touch)

- [x] Refine input experience (gesture experience)
- [ ] More Models (I need donation)
- [ ] Signal Processing Algorithm (Papers, papers!)

## Acknowledgements

People familiar with me know that I don't use Apple MacBook (so development work of this driver occurs on a Surface Pro 4). People probably think it doesn't make sense that I started this project. The motivation behind this project origin from complaints from my girlfriend. Hearing about frequent complains about Dell XPS 13's touchpad (though it passed Precision Touchpad certification), I decided to start this project, so by the time she switches to MacBook Pro, she will have excellent touchpad experience out-of-box, even on Windows. This driver is made for you, but also for everyone.

I would like to thank projects like [magictrackpad2-dkms](https://github.com/robbi5/magictrackpad2-dkms) and [macbook12-spi-driver](https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver) that inspire me. I would also like to thank my friends for providing me immense help on devices and testing.
