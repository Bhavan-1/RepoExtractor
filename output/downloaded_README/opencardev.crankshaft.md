Crankshaft = Raspberry Pi ðŸ’– Android Auto
==

Crankshaft is a turn-key free (as in freedom) distribution for the Raspberry Pi. It transforms your Raspberry Pi to an [Android Auto headunit](https://www.android.com/auto/).

This is the source code repository, just in case you want to build the system yourself. To get the binary without dealing with all this stuff, please head to [GetCrankshaft.com](http://getcrankshaft.com). Crankshaft is possible thanks to the power of [OpenAuto](https://github.com/f1xpl/openauto) and [aasdk](https://github.com/f1xpl/aasdk). Crankshaft and OpenAuto are in no way related or certfied by either Google or Android.



Getting Started
--

It's easy to get started even when you're new to Raspberry Pi and know nothing about electronics. [Check here for the latest guide](https://github.com/htruong/crankshaft/wiki/Getting-started-with-Crankshaft). 

**Where to get help**: The premier place to discuss your question or idea is [the subreddit (BETA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crankshaft/). 

**FAQs**: Several other questions such as "Does OK Google work? Can I use a custom screen?" get asked a lot and might have already been answered in the [tips and tricks](https://github.com/htruong/crankshaft/wiki/Hidden-tips,-tricks,-settings,-etc.) page. If you have questions, [check out the growing FAQs](https://github.com/htruong/crankshaft/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

**Project pictures**: If you have pictures of your project, feel free to [add to the collection](https://photos.app.goo.gl/81hQ6wTuLFNGmRHh2).


**Touchscreens**: If you don't have the official touch screen and just want to see whether Crankshaft will work with the phone you have before spending money to buy the screen, try [this trick](https://github.com/htruong/crankshaft/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#i-have-a-pi3-how-can-i-test-crankshaft-compatibility-with-my-phone-before-i-spend-the-money-to-buy-the-official-screen).

**Phones and Pi combinations**: If you want to know for sure or have a chance to try it, please spend a minute to report back whether it works or not at [Hardware Compatibility List](https://github.com/htruong/crankshaft/issues/2). If Crankshaft doesn't work but you're capable of compiling software on Linux, there is a chance chance you can get it to work [following OpenAuto's simple intructions](https://github.com/htruong/crankshaft/issues/2).



**Problems and requests**: To file a bug or an enhancement idea, please file an issue on this repository. To help us help you, before reporting problems to this repository, I would appreciate if you could try [running Crankshaft under X11](https://github.com/htruong/crankshaft/wiki/Crankshaft-dev-mode). This will help in cases you use non standard hardware, for example, a custom HDMI screen. To make the distribution easier and lightweight, by default I opted to run OpenAuto under EGL instead of relying on X11, and this might cause OpenAuto to behave in ways that OpenAuto's author rather not deal with :)

What's new:

- Syncs with latest OpenAuto and AASDK.
- Buttons now look a bit nicer.
- Featured default wallpaper: Eve's "Camping (with Dock)"!
- Dev mode does not shut down crankshaft on ntp sync anymore.

What's new for developers:

- Now you can build your own Crankshaft system on raspbian \
  Use the scripts in `rpi_buildsystem`.
- The crankshaft buildscript is improved.
- Wifi client is supported in dev mode.
- Watchdog module is fixed & really enabled.
- Dev mode will have ntp enabled.

Known issues:

- If Android Auto doesn't automatically launch, disable Android debug.
- X11 still does not show cursors on projection mode, so no mouse.
- X11 will activate screensaver if not touched for 10 minutes.

#### Version alpha0.2.3 2018-04-18

What's new:

- Now you can configure many of the settings normally you have to use hardware jumpers\
  through software settings. Open the file `/boot/crankshaft/crankshaft_env.sh` to edit.
- Startup scripts via `/boot/crankshaft`. You can use both bash and python.
- Triggerhappy actions are exposed now via `boot/crankshaft/triggerhappy.conf`
- Fix "Crankshaft shuts down immediately after NTP time sync" when you set \
  `NO_CONNECTION_POWEROFF_MINS` on `crankshaft_env.sh` to 0. Fix #77.
- Some minor bug fixes: 
  Now crankshaft should mount `boot` and `root` ro correctly.\
  Video FPS is 30 by default for now (less janky animations).

What's new for developers:

- Clearer image building instructions.

Known issues:

- If Android Auto doesn't automatically launch, disable Android debug.
- X11 still does not show cursors on projection mode, so no mouse.




Other projects

OpenAuto and Crankshaft are not the only people in this world experimenting with this idea. 

Some other developers worked hard on this too, and you might want to give them a try. [Here is another solution that works on the Pi](https://github.com/viktorgino/headunit-desktop), [here is one that works on an Android tablet](https://github.com/borconi/headunit).

*Conflicts of interests*: Huan Truong is a independent developer he declares no business relationship as well as no conflicts of interests between him and the following entities: Google, Android, OpenAuto/aasdk, Michal Swaz, Viktor Gino, Emil Borconi-Szedressy.
