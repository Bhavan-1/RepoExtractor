Approach0 is a math-aware search engine.

Math search can be helpful in math Q&A websites: Assume you are doing a tough
question on your math homework, you type in search box the exact question from
your textbook, after a second (maybe too much) you get all the similar questions
that somebody has already asked about, they are perhaps answered!

## A little history
The author has been doing a
[math-only search engine prototype](https://github.com/t-k-/opmes)
during his graduate research. Shortly after that prototype is implemented, this
project is created. Its mission is to combine both math-search and fulltext search.
Now I am happy this goal is achieved too! The next step is continuously develop
this project and focus on improving effectiveness and efficiency.

Technically, this search engine is still based on previously existing and established
fulltext search methods. On top of these, it adds new ideas and algorithms to handle
structural content (see paper
[1](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/thesis-ref.pdf) and
[2](https://github.com/tkhost/tkhost.github.io/raw/master/opmes/ecir2016.pdf))

For now only math-aware search is implemented, but this idea can be generally
applied to other structural text search such as code, chemistry formula and more.
