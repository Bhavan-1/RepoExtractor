# Installing Debian on your Kindle

## Update: I am no longer working on this project. I ended up breaking my Kindle because I'm an idiot. I am still accepting pull requests, but I am unable to test them, so please make sure that your code is stable. Thanks, lovelies!

1. Jailbreak your Kindle.

    Jailbreaking your Kindle allows non-Amazon applications to run on your Kindle.
    In order to Jailbreak your device you need a Paperwhite 2 or 3, Kindle Touch 2 or 3, Kindle Voyage or Kindle Oasis.
    I'm using a Kindle Touch 3.

    Follow the steps below to jailbreak your device.

    * Reset your device:

        To do this, go to settings and click the menu button (`☰ or ⋮`) in the
        top right-hand corner, it should look like this:

        ![alt text](Images/ResetKindle.jpg "Reset your Kindle")

        **Please note:** Resetting your device involves removing **all** your books, saved passwords and documents, so **make sure to backup anything you don't have stored in the cloud**.
        This process may take a while, so go grab a beverage of your choice. 🍹

2. Downgrade your Kindle's operating system.

    Before you do anything, you need to figure out which model of Kindle you have.
    Use the table below to find your model number using your serial number.

    To find your serial number, just grab your Kindle, head to the Settings page `Menu > Settings` then tap `Menu > Device Info`. Once you have you model number, it's time to downgrade your Kindle.
