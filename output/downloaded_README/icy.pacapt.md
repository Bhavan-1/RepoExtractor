## Name

`pacapt` - An `Arch`'s pacman-like package manager for some `Unices`.

## Description

An `Arch`'s pacman-like package manager for some `Unices`.
Actually this `Bash` script provides a wrapper for system's package manager.
For example, on `CentOS` machines, you can install `htop` with command

    $ pacapt -S htop

Instead of remembering various options/tools on different `OS`s, you only
need a common way to manipulate packages. Not all options of the native
package manager are ported; the tool only provides a very basic interface
to search, install, remove packages, and/or update the system.

`Arch`'s pacman is chosen, as pacman is quite smart when it divides all
packages-related operations into three major groups:
  `Synchronize`, `Query` and `Remove/Clean up`.
It has a clean man page, and it is the only tool needed to manipulate
official packages on system.
(`Debian`, for example, requires you to use `apt-get`, `dpkg`, and/or `aptitude`.)

The tool supports the following package managers:

* `pacman`        by `Arch Linux`, `ArchBang`, `Manjaro`, etc.
* `dpkg/apt-get`  by `Debian`, `Ubuntu`, etc.
* `homebrew`      by `Mac OS X`
* `macports`      by `Mac OS X`
* `yum/rpm`       by `Redhat`, `CentOS`, `Fedora`, etc.
* `portage`       by `Gentoo`
* `zypper`        by `OpenSUSE`
* `pkgng`         by `FreeBSD`
* `cave`          by `Exherbo Linux`
* `pkg_tools`     by `OpenBSD`
* `sun_tools`     by `Solaris(SunOS)`
* `apk`           by `Alpine Linux`
* `tazpkg`        by `SliTaz Linux`
* `swupd`         by `Clear Linux`

## Installation

1. This script shouldn't be installed on an Arch-based system;
2. On `FreeBSD` and `Alpine Linux`, please install `bash` package first.

### Install stable script from Github

You can download the stable script and make it executable

````
$ sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/pacapt \
https://github.com/icy/pacapt/raw/ng/pacapt

$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pacapt

$ sudo ln -sv /usr/local/bin/pacapt /usr/local/bin/pacman || true
````

On some system, `/usr/local/bin` is not in the search paths when the
command is executed by `sudo`. You may want to use `/usr/bin/pacman`
or `/usr/bin/pacapt` instead.

This stable script is generated from the latest stable branch,
which is `v2.0` at the moment. If you want to compile a script
from its components, please make sure you use a correct branch.
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

### Installation from Pival81 repository

@Pival81 creates specification to build packages on various Linux
distributions (CentOS, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, RHEL, Ubuntu).
The specification can be found under the `contrib/` directory.

@Pival81 also builds packages which are ready to use on your machine.
See the following link for details.

  http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:Pival81&package=pacapt

## Usage

Some basic command line options

* `-h` (`--help`): Print help message;
* `-P`: Print list of supported operations;
* `-V`: Print script version

Some popular options of the original `ArchLinux`'s `pacman` program
are supported and listed in the table in the next section.
