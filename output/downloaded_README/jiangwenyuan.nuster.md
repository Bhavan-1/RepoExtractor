# Introduction

Nuster is a high performance caching proxy server based on HAProxy.
It is 100% compatible with HAProxy, and takes full advantage of the ACL
functionality of HAProxy to provide fine-grained caching policy based on
the content of request, response or server status. Its features include:

 * All features of HAProxy are inherited, 100% compatible with HAProxy
 * Powerful dynamic cache ability
   * Based on HTTP method, URI, path, query, header, cookies, etc
   * Based on HTTP request or response contents, etc
   * Based on environment variables, server state, etc
   * Based on SSL version, SNI, etc
   * Based on connection rate, number, byte, etc
 * Extremely fast
 * Cache purging
 * Cache stats
 * Cache management
 * HTTP2
 * HTTPS supports on both frontend and backend
 * HTTP compression
 * HTTP rewriting and redirection

# Performance

Nuster is very fast, some test shows nuster is almost three times faster than
nginx when both using single core, and nearly two times faster than nginx and
three times faster than varnish when using all cores.

See [detailed benchmark](https://github.com/jiangwenyuan/nuster/wiki/Web-cache-server-performance-benchmark:-nuster-vs-nginx-vs-varnish-vs-squid)


# Setup

## Download

Download stable version from [Download](Download.md) page for production use, otherwise git clone the source code.

## Build

```
make TARGET=linux2628 USE_LUA=1 LUA_INC=/usr/include/lua5.3 USE_OPENSSL=1 USE_PCRE=1 USE_ZLIB=1
make install PREFIX=/usr/local/nuster
```

> use `USE_PTHREAD_PSHARED=1` to use pthread lib

> omit `USE_LUA=1 LUA_INC=/usr/include/lua5.3 USE_OPENSSL=1 USE_PCRE=1 USE_ZLIB=1` if unnecessary

See [HAProxy README](README) for details.

## Start

Create a config file called `nuster.conf` like [Example](#example), and

`/usr/local/nuster/sbin/nuster -f nuster.conf`

## Docker

```
docker pull nuster/nuster
docker run -d -v /path/to/nuster.cfg:/etc/nuster/nuster.cfg:ro -p 8080:8080 nuster/nuster
```

# Usage

Nuster is based on HAProxy, all directives from HAProxy are supported in nuster.

In order to use cache functionality, `nuster cache on` should be declared in **global**
section and some rules should be added into **backend** or **listen** section.

If `nuster cache off` is declared or there is no `nuster cache on|off` directive,
nuster acts just like HAProxy, as a TCP and HTTP load balancer.

# Directives

## global: nuster cache

**syntax:** nuster cache on|off [data-size size] [dict-size size] [purge-method method] [uri uri]

**default:** *none*

**context:** *global*

Determines whether to use cache or not.

A memory zone with a size of `data-size + dict-size` will be created. Except for
temporary data created and destroyed within request, all cache related data
including http response data, keys and overheads are stored in this memroy zone
and shared between all processes.

If no more memory can be allocated from this memory zone, new requests that should
be cached according to defined rules will not be cached unless some memory
are freed.

Temporary data are stored in a memory pool which allocates memory dynamically from
system in case there is no available memory in the pool.

A global internal counter monitors the memory usage of all http response data across
all processes, new requests will not be cached if the counter exceeds `data-size`.

### data-size

Determines the size of memory zone along with `dict-size`.

It accepts units like `m`, `M`, `g` and `G`. By default, the size is 1024 * 1024 bytes,
which is also the minimal size.

### dict-size

Determines the size of memory used by hash table.

It accepts units like `m`, `M`, `g` and `G`. By default, the size is 1024 * 1024 bytes,
which is also the minimal size.

Note that it only decides the memory used by hash table buckets not keys. In fact, keys are
stored in memory zone which is limited by `data-size`.

**dict-size** is different from **number of keys**. New keys can still be added to hash
table even if the number of keys exceeds dict-size as long as there are enough memory.

Nevertheless it may lead to a performance drop if `number of keys` is greater than `dict-size`.

An approximate number of keys multiplied by 8 (normally) as `dict-size` should work.

> dict-size will be removed in future release, automatically resizing hash table like first
version will be added back.

### purge-method

Define a customized HTTP method with max length of 14 to purge cache, it is `PURGE` by default.

### uri

Enable cache manager/stats API and define the endpoint:

`nuster cache on uri /_my/_unique/_/_cache/_uri`

By default, the cache manager/stats is disabled. When it is enabled, remember to restrict the
access(see [FAQ](#how-to-restrict-access)).

See [Cache Management](#cache-management) and [Cache stats](#cache-stats) for details.

## proxy: nuster cache

**syntax:** nuster cache [on|off]

**default:** *on*

**context:** *backend*, *listen*

Determines whether or not to use cache on this proxy, additional `nuster rule` should be defined.
It can be turned off separately by including `off`.
If there are filters on this proxy, put this directive after all other filters.

## nuster rule

**syntax:** nuster rule name [key KEY] [ttl TTL] [code CODE] [if|unless condition]

**default:** *none*

**context:** *backend*, *listen*

Define cache rule to specify cache creating conditions, cache properties. At least one rule should be defined.

```
nuster cache on

# cache request `/asdf` for 30 seconds
nuster rule asdf ttl 30 if { path /asdf }

# cache if the request path begins with /img/
nuster rule img if { path_beg /img/ }

# cache if the response header `cache` is `yes`
acl resHdrCache res.hdr(cache) yes
nuster rule r1 if resHdrCache
```

It is possible and recommended to declare multiple rules in the same section. The order is important because
the matching process stops on the first match.

```
acl pathA path /a.html
nuster cache on
nuster rule all ttl 3600
nuster rule path01 ttl 60 if pathA
```

rule `path01` will never match because first rule will cache everything.

### name

Define a name for this rule. It will be used in cache manager API, it does not
have to be unique, but it might be a good idea to make it unique. rule with same
name are treated as one.

### key KEY

Define the key for cache, it takes a string combined by following keywords
with `.` separator:

 * method:       http method, GET/POST...
 * scheme:       http or https
 * host:         the host in the request
 * uri:          first slash to end of the url
 * path:         the URL path of the request
 * delimiter:    '?' if query exists otherwise empty
 * query:        the whole query string of the request
 * header\_NAME: the value of header `NAME`
 * cookie\_NAME: the value of cookie `NAME`
 * param\_NAME:  the value of query `NAME`
 * body:         the body of the request

By default the key is `method.scheme.host.uri`

Example

```
GET http://www.example.com/q?name=X&type=Y

http header:
GET /q?name=X&type=Y HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
ASDF: Z
Cookie: logged_in=yes; user=nuster;
```

Should result:

 * method:       GET
 * scheme:       http
 * host:         www.example.com
 * uri:          /q?name=X&type=Y
 * path:         /q
 * delimiter:    ?
 * query:        name=X&type=Y
 * header\_ASDF: Z
 * cookie\_user: nuster
 * param\_type:  Y
 * body:         (empty)

So default key produces `GET.http.www.example.com./q?name=X&type=Y.`, and
`key method.scheme.host.path.header_ASDF.cookie_user.param_type` produces
`GET.http.www.example.com./q.Z.nuster.Y.`

If a request has the same key as a cached http response data, then cached
data will be sent to the client.

### ttl TTL

Set a TTL on key, after the TTL has expired, the key will be deleted.
It accepts units like `d`, `h`, `m` and `s`. Default ttl is `3600` seconds.
Set to `0` if you don't want to expire the key.

### code CODE1,CODE2...

Cache only if the response status code is CODE. By default, only 200 response
is cached. You can use `all` to cache all responses.

```
nuster rule only200
nuster rule 200and404 code 200,404
nuster rule all code all
```

### if|unless condition

Define when to cache using HAProxy ACL.
See **7. Using ACLs and fetching samples** section in [HAProxy configuration](doc/configuration.txt)

# Cache Management

Cache can be managed via a manager API which endpoints is defined by `uri` and can be accessed by making HTTP
requests along with some headers.

**Eanble and define the endpoint**

```
nuster cache on uri /nuster/cache
```

**Basic usage**

`curl -X POST -H "X: Y" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache`

**REMEMBER to enable access restriction**

## Enable and disable cache rule

Rule can be disabled at run time through manager uri. Disabled rule will not be processed, nor will the
cache created by that.

***headers***

| header | value       | description
| ------ | -----       | -----------
| state  | enable      | enable  rule
|        | disable     | disable rule
| name   | rule NAME   | the rule to be enabled/disabled
|        | proxy NAME  | all rules belong to proxy NAME
|        | *           | all rules

Keep in mind that if name is not unique, **all** rules with that name will be disabled/enabled.

***Examples***

* Disable cache rule r1

  `curl -X POST -H "name: r1" -H "state: disable" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache`

* Disable all cache rule defined in proxy app1b

  `curl -X POST -H "name: app1b" -H "state: disable" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache`

* Enable all cache rule

  `curl -X POST -H "name: *" -H "state: enable" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache`

## TTL

Change the TTL. It only affects the TTL of the responses to be cached, **does not** update the TTL of existing caches.

***headers***

| header | value      | description
| ------ | -----      | -----------
| ttl    | new TTL    | see `ttl` in `nuster rule`
| name   | rule NAME  | the cache rule to be changed
|        | proxy NAME | all cache rules belong to proxy NAME
|        | *          | all cache rules

***Examples***

```
curl -X POST -H "name: r1" -H "ttl: 0" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
curl -X POST -H "name: r2" -H "ttl: 2h" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
```

## Update state and TTL

state and ttl can be updated at the same time

```
curl -X POST -H "name: r1" -H "ttl: 0" -H "state: enabled" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
```

## Purge Cache

There are several ways to purge cache by making HTTP `PURGE` requests to the manager uri defined by `uri`.

You can define customized http method using `purge-method MYPURGE` other than the default `PURGE` in case
you need to forward `PURGE` to backend servers.

### Purge one specific url

This method deletes the specific url that is being requested, like this:

`curl -XPURGE https://127.0.0.1/imgs/test.jpg`

It creates a key of `GET.scheme.host.uri`, and deletes the cache with that key.

Note by default cache key contains `Host`, if you cache a request like `http://example.com/test`
and purge from localhost you need to specify `Host` header:

`curl -XPURGE -H "Host: example.com" http://127.0.0.1/test`


### Purge by name

Cache can be purged by making HTTP `PURGE`(or `purge-method`) requests to the manager uri along with a `name` HEADER.

***headers***

| header | value            | description
| ------ | -----            | -----------
| name   | nuster rule NAME | caches belong to rule ${NAME} will be purged
|        | proxy NAME       | caches belong to proxy ${NAME}
|        | *                | all caches

***Examples***

```
# purge all caches
curl -X PURGE -H "name: *" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
# purge all caches belong to proxy applb
curl -X PURGE -H "name: app1b" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
# purge all caches belong to rule r1
curl -X PURGE -H "name: r1" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
```

### Purge by host

You can also purge cache by host, all caches belong to that host will be deleted:

***headers***

| header | value | description
| ------ | ----- | -----------
| x-host | HOST  | the ${HOST}

***Examples***

```
curl -X PURGE -H "x-host: 127.0.0.1:8080" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
```

### Purge by path

By default, the query part is also used as cache key, so there will be multiple caches if the query differs.

For example, for cache rule `nuster rule imgs if { path_beg /imgs/ }`, and request

```
curl https://127.0.0.1/imgs/test.jpg?w=120&h=120
curl https://127.0.0.1/imgs/test.jpg?w=180&h=180
```

There will be two cache objects since the default key contains query part.

In order to delete that, you can

***delete one by one in case you know all queries***

```
curl -XPURGE https://127.0.0.1/imgs/test.jpg?w=120&h=120
curl -XPURGE https://127.0.0.1/imgs/test.jpg?w=180&h=180
```

It does not work if you don't know all queries.

***use a customized key and delete once in case that the query part is irrelevant***

Define a key like `nuster rule imgs key method.scheme.host.path if { path_beg /imgs }`, in this way only one cache
will be created, and you can purge without query:

`curl -XPURGE https://127.0.0.1/imgs/test.jpg`

It does not work if the query part is required.

***delete by rule NAME***

`curl -X PURGE -H "name: imgs" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache`

It does not work if the nuster rule is defined something like `nuster rule static if { path_beg /imgs/ /css/ }`.

This method provides a way to purge just by path:

***headers***

| header | value | description
| ------ | ----- | -----------
| path   | PATH  | caches with ${PATH} will be purged
| x-host | HOST  | and host is ${HOST}

***Examples***

```
#delete all caches which path is /imgs/test.jpg
curl -X PURGE -H "path: /imgs/test.jpg" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
#delete all caches which path is /imgs/test.jpg and belongs to 127.0.0.1:8080
curl -X PURGE -H "path: /imgs/test.jpg" -H "x-host: 127.0.0.1:8080" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
```

### Purge by regex

You can also purge cache by regex, the caches which path match the regex will be deleted.

***headers***

| header | value | description
| ------ | ----- | -----------
| regex  | REGEX | caches which path match with ${REGEX} will be purged
| x-host | HOST  | and host is ${HOST}

***Examples***

```
#delete all caches which path starts with /imgs and ends with .jpg
curl -X PURGE -H "regex: ^/imgs/.*\.jpg$" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
#delete all caches which path starts with /imgs and ends with .jpg and belongs to 127.0.0.1:8080
curl -X PURGE -H "regex: ^/imgs/.*\.jpg$" -H "127.0.0.1:8080" http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache
```

**PURGE CAUTION**

1. **ENABLE ACCESS RESTRICTION**

2. If there are mixed headers, use the precedence of `name`, `path & host`, `path`, `regex & host`, `regex`, `host`

   `curl -XPURGE -H "name: rule1" -H "path: /imgs/a.jpg"`: purge by name

3. If there are redundant headers, use the first occurrence

   `curl -XPURGE -H "name: rule1" -H "name: rule2"`: purge by `rule1`

4. `regex` is **NOT glob**

   For example, all jpg files under /imgs should be `^/imgs/.*\.jpg$` instead of `/imgs/*.jpg`

# Cache Stats

Cache stats can be accessed by making HTTP GET request to the endpoint defined by `uri`;

## Eanble and define the endpoint

```
nuster cache on uri /nuster/cache
```

## Usage

`curl http://127.0.0.1/nuster/cache`

## Output

* used\_mem:  The memory used for response, not include overheads.
* req\_total: Total request number handled by cache enabled backends, not include the requests handled by backends without cache enabled
* req\_hit:   Number of requests handled by cache
* req\_fetch: Fetched from backends
* req\_abort: Aborted when fetching from backends

Others are very straightforward.

# FAQ

## How to debug?

Set `debug` in `global` section, or start `nuster` with `-d`.

Cache related debug messages start with `[CACHE]`.

## How to cache POST request?

Enable `option http-buffer-request` and set `body` in cache rule `key`.

By default, the cache key does not include the body of the request, remember to put
`body` in key field.

Note that the body of the request maybe incomplete, refer to **option http-buffer-request**
section in [HAProxy configuration](doc/configuration.txt) for details.

Also it might be a good idea to put it separately in a dedicated backend as example does.

## How to restrict access?

You can use the powerful HAProxy acl, something like this

```
acl network_allowed src 127.0.0.1
acl purge_method method PURGE
http-request deny if purge_method !network_allowed
```

## How to enable HTTP2

```
bind :443 ssl crt pub.pem alpn h2,http/1.1
```
