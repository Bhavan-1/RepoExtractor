[![Gitter chat][Gitter badge]][Gitter]
[![License: MIT](./image/license_badge.svg)](./LICENSE)

A fast C++ header-only library to help you quickly build parallel programs with complex task dependencies.

# Why Cpp-Taskflow?

Cpp-Taskflow lets you quickly build parallel dependency graphs using modern C++17.
It is by far faster, more expressive, and easier for drop-in integration than existing libraries such as [OpenMP Tasking][OpenMP Tasking] and 
[TBB FlowGraph][TBB FlowGraph].

*"Cpp-Taskflow is the cleanest Task API I've ever seen," Damien*

*"Cpp-Taskflow allows us to explore more parallelism and go beyond the scale we had," OpenTimer developers*


# Get Started with Cpp-Taskflow

The following example [simple.cpp](./example/simple.cpp) shows the basic API you need to use Cpp-Taskflow.

```cpp
#include "taskflow.hpp"  // the only include you need

int main(){
  
  tf::Taskflow tf(std::thread::hardware_concurrency());

  auto [A, B, C, D] = tf.silent_emplace(
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskA\n"; },               //  the taskflow graph
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskB\n"; },               // 
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskC\n"; },               //          +---+          
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskD\n"; }                //    +---->| B |-----+   
  );                                                 //    |     +---+     |
                                                     //  +---+           +-v-+ 
  A.precede(B);  // B runs after A                   //  | A |           | D | 
  A.precede(C);  // C runs after A                   //  +---+           +-^-+ 
  B.precede(D);  // D runs after B                   //    |     +---+     |    
  C.precede(D);  // D runs after C                   //    +---->| C |-----+    
                                                     //          +---+          
  tf.wait_for_all();  // block until finished

  return 0;
}
```

Compile and run the code with the following commands:

```bash
~$ g++ simple.cpp -std=c++1z -O2 -lpthread -o simple
~$ ./simple
TaskA
TaskC  <-- concurrent with TaskB
TaskB  <-- concurrent with TaskC
TaskD
```

It is clear now Cpp-Taskflow is powerful in parallelizing tasks with complex dependencies.
The following example demonstrates a concurrent execution of 10 tasks with 15 dependencies.
With Cpp-Taskflow, you only need ***15 lines of code***.

<img align="right" src="image/complex.png" width="30%">

```cpp
// source dependencies
S.precede(a0);    // S runs before a0
S.precede(b0);    // S runs before b0
S.precede(a1);    // S runs before a1

// a_ -> others
a0.precede(a1);   // a0 runs before a1
a0.precede(b2);   // a0 runs before b2
a1.precede(a2);   // a1 runs before a2
a1.precede(b3);   // a1 runs before b3
a2.precede(a3);   // a2 runs before a3

// b_ -> others
b0.precede(b1);   // b0 runs before b1
b1.precede(b2);   // b1 runs before b2
b2.precede(b3);   // b2 runs before b3
b2.precede(a3);   // b2 runs before a3

// target dependencies
a3.precede(T);    // a3 runs before T
b1.precede(T);    // b1 runs before T
b3.precede(T);    // b3 runs before T
```


# Create a Taskflow Graph
Cpp-Taskflow has very expressive and neat methods to create dependency graphs.
Most applications are developed through the following three steps.

## Step 1: Create a Task
To start a task dependency graph, 
create a taskflow object and specify the number of working threads.
```cpp
tf::Taskflow tf(std::max(1u, std::thread::hardware_concurrency()));
```
Create a task via the method `emplace` and get a pair of `Task` and `future`.
```cpp
auto [A, F] = tf.emplace([](){ std::cout << "Task A\n"; return 1; });
```
If you don't need a `future` to retrieve the result, use the method `silent_emplace` instead.
```cpp
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([](){ std::cout << "Task A\n"; });
```
Both methods implement variadic templates and can take arbitrary numbers of callables to create multiple tasks at one time.
```cpp
auto [A, B, C, D] = tf.silent_emplace(
  [] () { std::cout << "Task A\n"; },
  [] () { std::cout << "Task B\n"; },
  [] () { std::cout << "Task C\n"; },
  [] () { std::cout << "Task D\n"; }
);
```

## Step 2: Define Task Dependencies
Once tasks are created in the pool, you need to specify task dependencies in a 
[Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) fashion.
The handle `Task` supports different methods for you to describe task dependencies.

**Precede**: Adding a preceding link forces one task to run ahead of one another.
```cpp
A.precede(B);  // A runs before B.
```

**Broadcast**: Adding a broadcast link forces one task to run ahead of other(s).
```cpp
A.broadcast(B, C, D);  // A runs before B, C, and D.
```

**Gather**: Adding a gathering link forces one task to run after other(s).
```cpp
A.gather(B, C, D);  // A runs after B, C, and D.
```

**Linearize**: Linearizing a task sequence adds a  preceding link to each adjacent pair.
```cpp
tf.linearize(A, B, C, D);  // A runs before B, B runs before C, and C runs before D.
```

## Step 3: Execute the Tasks
There are three methods to carry out a task dependency graph, `dispatch`, `silent_dispatch`, and `wait_for_all`.
```cpp
auto future = tf.dispatch();  // non-blocking, returns with a future immediately.
tf.silent_dispatch();         // non-blocking, no return
```
Calling `wait_for_all` will block until all tasks complete.
```cpp
tf.wait_for_all();
```

# Debug a Taskflow Graph
Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to debug. 
We suggest (1) naming tasks and dumping the graph, and (2) starting with single thread before going multiple.
Currently, Cpp-Taskflow supports [GraphViz][GraphViz] format.

```cpp
// debug.cpp
tf::Taskflow tf(0);  // force the master thread to execute all tasks
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([] () { /* ... */ }).name("A");
auto B = tf.silent_emplace([] () { /* ... */ }).name("B");
auto C = tf.silent_emplace([] () { /* ... */ }).name("C");
auto D = tf.silent_emplace([] () { /* ... */ }).name("D");
auto E = tf.silent_emplace([] () { /* ... */ }).name("E");

A.broadcast(B, C, E); 
C.precede(D);
B.broadcast(D, E); 

std::cout << tf.dump();
```
Run the program and inspect whether dependencies are expressed in the right way. 
There are a number of free [GraphViz tools][AwesomeGraphViz] you could find online
to visualize your Taskflow graph.

<img align="right" src="image/graphviz.png" width="25%">

```bash
~$ ./debug

// Taskflow with five tasks and six dependencies
digraph Taskflow {
  "A" -> "B"
  "A" -> "C"
  "A" -> "E"
  "B" -> "D"
  "B" -> "E"
  "C" -> "D"
}
```

# API Reference

## Taskflow API

The class `tf::Taskflow` is the main place to create taskflow graphs and carry out task dependencies.
The table below summarizes its commonly used methods.

| Method   | Argument  | Return  | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Taskflow | none      | none    | construct a taskflow with the worker count equal to max hardware concurrency |
| Taskflow | size      | none    | construct a taskflow with a given number of workers |
| emplace  | callables | tasks, futures | insert nodes to execute the given callables; results can be retrieved from the returned futures |
| silent_emplace  | callables | tasks         | insert nodes to execute the given callables |
| placeholder     | none        | task         | insert a node without any work; work can be assigned later |
| linearize       | task list   | none         | create a linear dependency in the given task list |
| parallel_for    | beg, end, callable, group | task pair | apply the callable in parallel and group-by-group to the result of dereferencing every iterator in the range | 
| reduce | beg, end, res, op, group | task pair | apply a binary operator group-by-group to reduce a range of elements to a single result | 
| dispatch        | none        | future | dispatch the current graph and return a shared future to block on completeness |
| silent_dispatch | none        | none | dispatch the current graph | 
| wait_for_all    | none        | none | dispatch the current graph and block until all graphs including previously dispatched ones finish |
| num_nodes       | none        | size | return the number of nodes in the current graph |  
| num_workers     | none        | size | return the number of working threads in the pool |  
| num_topologies  | none        | size | return the number of dispatched graphs |
| dump            | none        | string | dump the current graph to a string of GraphViz format |

### *emplace/silent_emplace/placeholder*

The main different between `emplace` and `silent_emplace` is the return value.
The method `emplace` gives you a future object to retrieve the result of the callable 
when the task completes.
```cpp
// create a task through emplace
auto [task, future] = tf.emplace([](){ return 1; });
tf.wait_for_all();
assert(future.get() == 1);
```

If you don't care the return result, using `silent_emplace` to create a task can give you slightly better performance.
```cpp
// create a task through silent_emplace
auto task = tf.emplace([](){ return; });
tf.wait_for_all();
```

When task cannot be determined beforehand, you can create a placeholder and assign the calalble later.
```cpp
// create a placeholder and use it to build dependency
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([](){});
auto B = tf.placeholder();
A.precede(B);

// assign the callable later in the control flow
B.work([](){ /* do something */ });
```

### *linearize*

The method `linearize` lets you add a linear dependency between each adjacent pair of a task sequence.

<img align="right" width="40%" src="image/linearize.png">

```cpp
// linearize five tasks
tf.linearize(A, B, C, D);
```

### *parallel_for*

The method `parallel_for` creates a subgraph that applies the callable to each item in the given range of
a container.

<img align="right" width="40%" src="image/parallel_for.png">

```cpp
// apply callable to each container item in parallel
auto v = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};
auto [S, T] = tf.parallel_for(
  v.begin(),    // beg of range
  v.end(),      // end of range
  [] (int i) { 
    std::cout << "parallel in " << i << '\n';
  }
);

// add dependencies via S and T.
```

By default, the group size is 1. Changing the group size can force intra-group tasks to run sequentially
and inter-group tasks to run in parallel.
Depending on applications, different group sizes can result in significant performance hit.

<img align="right" width="20%" src="image/parallel_for_2.png">

```cpp
// apply callable to two container items at a time in parallel
auto v = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};
auto [S, T] = tf.parallel_for(
  v.begin(),    // beg of range
  v.end(),      // end of range
  [] (int i) { 
    std::cout << "AB and CD run in parallel" << '\n';
  },
  2  // group to execute two tasks at a time
);
```

### *reduce*

The method `reduce` creates a subgraph that applies a binary operator to a range of items in a container.
The result will be stored in the referenced `res` object passed to the method. 
It is your responsibility to assign it a correct initial value to reduce.

<img align="right" width="50%" src="image/reduce.png">

```cpp
auto v = {1, 2, 3, 4};
int sum {0};    // initial value
auto [S, T] = tf.reduce(
  v.begin(),    // beg of range
  v.end(),      // end of range
  sum,          // pass by reference
  std::plus<int>()
);

// add dependencies via S and T.
```

By default, the group size is 1. Changing the group size can force intra-group tasks to run sequentially
and inter-group tasks to run in parallel.
Depending on applications, different group sizes can result in significant performance hit.

<img align="right" width="45%" src="image/reduce_2.png">

```cpp
auto v = {1, 2, 3, 4}; 
int sum {0};
auto [S, T] = tf.reduce(
  v.begin(), v.end(), sum, std::plus<int>(), 2
);  
```

### *dispatch/silent_dispatch/wait_for_all*
Dispatching a taskflow graph will schedule threads to execute the current graph and return immediately.
The method `dispatch` gives you a future object to probe the execution progress while
`silent_dispatch` doesn't.

```cpp
auto future = tf.dispatch();
// do something else to overlap with the execution 
// ...
std::cout << "now I need to block on completion" << '\n';
future.get();
std::cout << "all tasks complete" << '\n';
```

If you need to block your program flow until all tasks finish, use `wait_for_all` instead.
```cpp
tf.wait_for_all();
std::cout << "all tasks complete" << '\n';
```

## Task API

Each `tf::Taskflow::Task` object is a lightweight handle for you to create dependencies in its associated graph. 
The table below summarizes its methods.

| Method         | Argument    | Return | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| name           | string      | self   | assign a human-readable name to the task |
| work           | callable    | self   | assign a work of a callable object to the task |
| precede        | task        | self   | enable this task to run *before* the given task |
| broadcast      | task list   | self   | enable this task to run *before* the given tasks |
| gather         | task list   | self   | enable this task to run *after* the given tasks |
| num_dependents | none        | size   | return the number of dependents (inputs) of this task |
| num_successors | none        | size   | return the number of successors (outputs) of this task |

### *name*

The method `name` lets you assign a human-readable string to a task.

```cpp
A.name("my name is A");
```

### *work*

The method `work` lets you assign a callable to a task.

```cpp
A.work([] () { std::cout << "hello world!"; });
```

### *precede*

The method `precede` is the basic building block to add a precedence between two tasks.

<img align="right" width="20%" src="image/precede.png">

```cpp
// make A runs before B
A.precede(B);
```

### *broadcast*

The method `broadcast` lets you precede a task to multiple tasks.

<img align="right" width="30%" src="image/broadcast.png">

```cpp
// make A run before B, C, D, and E
// B, C, D, and E run in parallel
A.broadcast(B, C, D, E);
```

### *gather*

The method `gather` lets you add multiple precedences to a task.

<img align="right" width="30%" src="image/gather.png">

```cpp
// B, C, D, and E run in parallel
// A runs after B, C, D, and E complete
A.gather(B, C, D, E);
```

# Caveats
While Cpp-Taskflow enables the expression of very complex task dependency graph that might contain 
thousands of task nodes and links, there are a few amateur pitfalls and mistakes to be aware of.

+ Having a cycle in a graph may result in running forever.
+ Trying to modify a dispatched task can result in undefined behavior.
+ Touching a taskflow from multiple threads are not safe.

Cpp-Taskflow is known to work on most Linux distributions and OSX.
Please [let me know][email me] if you found any issues in a particular platform.
