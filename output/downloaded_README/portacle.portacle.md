## About Portacle
Portacle is a portable Common Lisp environment. What this means is that it is a fully featured integrated development environment for use with Common Lisp that runs on all major platforms and can even be put onto a USB stick to carry around.

## What is this? How do I install it? How do I use it?
For most questions, see the [official website](https://portacle.github.io). It should give you a good presentation of what this is in detail, how to get set up, and how to use it.

## Compiling From Source
In order to build the portacle environment yourself, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/portacle/portacle/tree/master/build) in the `build/` directory of the repository. Note that you usually do not need to do this. The pre-made [release packages](https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases) should be sufficient.
