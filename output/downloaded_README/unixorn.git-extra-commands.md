A zsh plugin that packages some extra git helper scripts I've found. I only wrote a few of these scripts, and the ones I didn't each have whatever licensing is included in the file.

This collection doesn't actually require ZSH, but packaging it as a ZSH plugin makes it more convenient for people using a ZSH framework to use this collection.

If you wrote one of these scripts and want it removed from this collection, please either make a PR and/or file an issue against the repo and I will remove it.

## Installing

### Pre-requisites

A relatively recent version of `git`. The version of `git` Apple includes in macOS is very stale. You should really `brew install git` to get the current version if you're on macOS - if not for features, for security updates.

### Antigen

If you're using [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen):

1. Add `antigen bundle unixorn/git-extra-commands` to your `.zshrc` where you've listed your other plugins.
2. Close and reopen your Terminal/iTerm window to **refresh context** and use the plugin. Alternatively, you can run `antigen bundle unixorn/git-extra-commands` in a running shell to have `antigen` load the new plugin.

### oh-my-zsh

If you're using [oh-my-zsh](github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):

1. In the command line, change to _oh-my-zsh_'s custom plugin directory :

    `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`

2. Clone the repository into a new `git-extra-commands` directory:

    `git clone https://github.com/unixorn/git-extra-commands.git git-extra-commands`

3. Edit your `~/.zshrc` and add `git-extra-commands` – same as clone directory – to the list of plugins to enable:

    `plugins=( ... git-extra-commands )`

4. Then, restart your terminal application to **refresh context** and use the plugin. Alternatively, you can source your current shell configuration:

    `source ~/.zshrc`

### zgen

If you're using [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen):

1. Add `zgen load unixorn/git-extra-commands` to your `.zshrc` along with your other `zgen load` commands.
2. `zgen reset && zgen save`

### Bash / Manual Installation

Nothing here actually requires you to use ZSH or zgen, that's just a convenient distribution method for anyone using a ZSH framework.

If you aren't using any ZSH frameworks, or if you're a `bash` user, do the following steps:

1. `git clone` this repository
2. Add `cloneDirectory/bin` to your `$PATH`.

## Useful git aliases

Here are some helpful aliases for your `~/.gitconfig`

| alias | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `ahead-of-master = log --oneline origin/master..HEAD` | Show commits that haven't made it to master yet. |
| `fetch-pull-requests = fetch origin '+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pull/*'` | Fetch pull requests from github so you can `git checkout pull/123` and test them locally. |
| `roots = log --all --oneline --decorate --max-parents=0` | Show the root commits. |
| `unpushed = log @{u}..` | Show which commits have not been pushed to the tracking branch and are safe to amend/rebase. |
| `work-in-progress = rebase -i @{u}` | Starts an interactive rebase of all the commits you haven't pushed yet. Handy for collapsing a bunch of work-in-progress snapshots into logical commits before pushing, without having to worry about accidentally squashing a commit someone else has already referred to. |

## Miscellaneous Tips

### Rewrite git:// with https://

```sh
git config --global url."https://github".insteadOf git://github
```

### or replace with `ssh`

## Contributing

* Please include an entry both in the credits section of README.md for any scripts and a credit comment in the script itself in your PRs so authors get their work credited correctly.
* Please use `#!/usr/bin/env interpreter` instead of a direct path to the interpreter, this makes it easier for people to use more recent versions when the ones packaged with their OS (macOS and CentOS, I'm looking at you!) are stale.
