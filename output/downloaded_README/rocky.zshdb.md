[![Build Status Circle](https://circleci.com/gh/rocky/zshdb.svg?&style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/rocky/zshdb)

*zshdb* is debugger for zsh scripts. It started as a port of my bash
debugger [bashdb](http://bashdb.sf.net) so the commands used in
both are similar.

The command syntax generally follows that of the trepanning debuggers
and, more generally, GNU debugger *gdb*.

See [Installation](https://github.com/rocky/zshdb/wiki/Installation) for how to install.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/rocky/zshdb/wiki) and [documentation](http://zshdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for more information.
