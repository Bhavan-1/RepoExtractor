inspiration from the `terminalparty` theme of `OMZ` and the need for a minimalistic "git" prompt for version control , were the main two forces that drove me to create this. Also this too ["Ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga"](https://youtu.be/NrI-UBIB8Jki) ;)  

**if you want to see how much is the average time your prompt takes to load up after entering a git directory, then execute this in the git directory :**    
```bash
	for i in $(seq 1 10); do time $SHELL -i -c exit > /dev/null 2>&1; done
```

**a fully functional git repo - 17710 commits, on branch v4-dev, 1 unstaged, 6192 commits ahead, 333 behind and 1 untracked file**

**the normal prompt - prompt in non-git directories**

## what do those symbols mean?

* ``master i``: on branch ``master``, in its "i"nitial stage , where no remote has been added yet   
* ``master 2↑ 1✚``: on branch ``master``, ahead of remote by 2 commits, 1 file changed but not staged
* ``master 6?``: on branch ``master``, 6 files files untracked
* ``master 2✖ 3✚``: on branch ``master``, 2 unstaged, 3 files modified
* ``master ✓``: on branch ``master``, is clean
* ``mine 2↓ 3↑``: on branch ``mine``; your branch is behind by 2 and ahead by 3 commits; the repository is otherwise clean
* ``~/bashed-on-a-feeling 39 ♥``: the fire has been lit , the repo has a total of 39 commits 
* ``git``: you're in git repository 
* ``↕``: you're in git repository which has been diverged 

## installation
in the above examples I've made use of the Hasklug nerd font, a patched variant of [Hasklig](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hasklig) and [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) fonts.  
**the user is required to install and use any of the nerd fonts and Font Awesome font, inorder to render those fancy symbols that i've used.**      
the simplest way to install the fonts on a Linux distro would be to :  
* choose any one of the [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and the full font awesome set from this link [font awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/tree/master/use-on-desktop) to use it  
* download and copy all the fonts files(.ttf/.otf) to `~/.fonts` for current user or to /usr/share/fonts/[T/O]TF directory for all
* run `fc-cache -fv ~/.fonts` or if the downloaded files are in `/usr/local/share/fonts/` then `fc-cache -fv` to let freetype2 know of those fonts
* you can confirm they are installed correctly by running fc-list | grep "your font name"   

## start installing

on  your terminal:  
```bash
	cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/yedhink/bashed-on-a-feeling.git
	cd ~/bashed-on-a-feeling
	./install.sh
```
then restart your terminal. BOOM!  

## customizing symbols

**note that the editing , after installation, should be done on `.bashed-gitprompt.sh` file in your home(~) directory for the changes to take place**  
you can easily change any symbols used by the prompt. take a look to the file [.bashed-gitprompt.sh]() . you will find a bunch of variables, each of them with its default value. the variable names were meant to be auto-explanatory. Something like  

```bash
	: ${untracked_files:='?'}
```  
you can change the symbols with your custom ones , just by editing the line(s) like above one and replacing current symbol with yours. say for common dejavu sans fonts you can use:  
```bash
    : ${no_remote_added:='✘'}
    : ${commiticon:='♥'}
    : ${added_but_not_committed:='♡'}
    : ${committed_and_clean:='✔'}
    : ${ahead:='⬆'}
    : ${behind:='⬇'}
    : ${committed_but_modified_before_push:='✚'}
    : ${untracked_files:='⁇'}
    : ${gitprompt_normal:='☮'}
    : ${gitprompt_diverged:='☢'}
```  
you can make use of `gucharmap` or `https://char-map.herokuapp.com/` to check for glyphs support of the font of your choice.  

## normal prompt - when you're not in a git directory  
the prompt works in a way that it shows a git prompt only when you're in a git repo , otherwise a normal prompt of your choice will be displayed. inorder to customize the normal prompt , edit the line `export PS1=` inside the function `gitprompt()` in your `.bashrc` after installation.  

## customizing colors  
now it's possible to choose colors of your choice for both the normal and git prompts. your preferred colors can be set through the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.  
editing should be done on these lines by referring to the available colors:  
```bash
    # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
    # SET COLORS FOR THE PROMPT HERE  #
    # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

    # Edit Normal Prompt Colors Here
    normalHeart=$Red    # Color for the heart
    normalCDire=$Red    # Color for the current directory
    normalDolar=$Yellow # Color for primary prompt string $

    # Edit Git Prompt Colors Here
    gpDir=$Yellow # Color for current git directory
    gpBrn=$White  # Color for current git branch
    gpAMa=$Green  # Color for both total commits and check mark
    # this variable takes only background colors. so use colors like bgRed or bgBlue etc
    gpBck=$bgBlue # Background color for the box in which git or the diverged symbol is shown
```  
say for example , if you want to change the color of the heart symbol in normal prompt to yellow and the git/diverged symbol background in git prompt to red color:  
```bash
    normalHeart=$Yellow
    gpBck=$Red
```  
the available color variables like Red,Yellow etc will be available in your `.bashrc` after installation. after changing the colors either source the file or restart your terminal emulator to see the changes 

## uninstall :(  
* just comment out `PROMPT_COMMAND="gitprompt"` in your `.bashrc` to disable this prompt
* (optionally) remove the files `.bashed-gitprompt.sh` and `.cal.sh` from home
* (optionally) also remove the lines of code under the heading `bashed-on-a-feeling`in your `.bashrc`  
i meant these lines :    
```bash
	# # # # # # # # # # # #
	# bashed-on-a-feeling #
	# # # # # # # # # # # #

	# git prompt will be shown only when you move to a git dir
        gitprompt(){
            if `git status &> /dev/null`; then
                declare -i cno=0
                source ~/.bashed-gitprompt.sh
            else
                export PS1='\[$normalHeart\]♥ \[$normalCDire\]\W \[$Yellow\]\$\[\e[0m\] '
                gbranch=""
            fi
        }

	PROMPT_COMMAND="gitprompt"
```

## faq
---

#### why the colors in the above pics and the ones being displayed on my terminal are different? 

**A**: it's because you/a program changed the color palette of your terminal to something different than the default one.  
run this piece of code to check out your colorscheme :  
```bash
 for fg_color in {0..7}; do
        set_foreground=$(tput setaf $fg_color)
        for bg_color in {0..7}; do
            set_background=$(tput setab $bg_color)
            echo -n $set_background$set_foreground
            printf ' F:%s B:%s ' $fg_color $bg_color
        done
        echo $(tput sgr0)
    done
```

#### why are the symbols rendered as empty boxes/not being displayed as it should be? 

**A**:  you need an unicode font (Font Awesome is a must and also a primary font for your terminal ,  
		like [Awesome Terminal Fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) or nerd fonts like Hasklug for Linux or Sauce Code Pro, Menlo or Monaco on Mac OS X, or Monospace on Ubuntu etc) installed on your system for rendering the glyphs properly. refer to [font installation](https://github.com/yedhink/bashed-on-a-feeling#installation) on how to install the font.
