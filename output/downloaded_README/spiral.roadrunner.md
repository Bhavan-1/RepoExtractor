RoadRunner is an open source (MIT licensed), high-performance PSR-7 PHP application server, load balancer and process manager.
It supports service model with ability to extend it's functionality on a project basis.

Features:
--------
- PSR-7 HTTP server (file uploads, error handling, static files, hot reload, middlewares, event listeners)
- extendable service model (plus PHP compatible RPC server)
- no external PHP dependencies, drop-in (based on [Goridge](https://github.com/spiral/goridge))
- load balancer, process manager and task pipeline
- frontend agnostic (queue, REST, PSR-7, async php, etc)
- works over TCP, unix sockets and standard pipes
- automatic worker replacement and safe PHP process destruction
- worker lifecycle management (create/allocate/destroy timeouts)
- payload context and body
- control over max jobs per worker
- protocol, worker and job level error management (including PHP errors)
- memory leak failswitch
- very fast (~250k rpc calls per second on Ryzen 1700X over 16 threads)
- works on Windows

Getting Started:
--------

#### Downloading RoadRunner
The easiest way to get the latest RoadRunner version is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for
OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Instructions for using these binaries are on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/releases).

#### Building RoadRunner
RoadRunner can be compiled on Linux, OSX, Windows and other 64 bit environments as the only requirement is Go 1.8+ itself.

To build:

```
$ make
```

To test:

```
$ make test
```

Using RoadRunner:
--------

In order to use RoadRunner you only have to place `.rr.yaml` file in a root of your php project:

```yaml
# rpc bus allows php application and external clients to talk to rr services.
rpc:
  # enable rpc server
  enable: true

  # rpc connection DSN. Supported TCP and Unix sockets.
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

# http service configuration.
http:
  # set to false to disable http server.
  enable:     true

  # http host to listen.
  address:    0.0.0.0:8080

  # max POST request size, including file uploads in MB.
  maxRequest: 200

  # file upload configuration.
  uploads:
    # list of file extensions which are forbidden for uploading.
    forbid: [".php", ".exe", ".bat"]

  # http worker pool configuration.
  workers:
    # php worker command.
    command:  "php psr-worker.php"

    # connection method (pipes, tcp://:9000, unix://socket.unix).
    relay:    "pipes"

    # worker pool configuration.
    pool:
      # number of workers to be serving.
      numWorkers: 4

      # maximum jobs per worker, 0 - unlimited.
      maxJobs:  0

      # for how long pool should attempt to allocate free worker (request timeout). Nanoseconds atm. (60s)
      allocateTimeout: 60000000000

      # amount of time given to worker to gracefully destruct itself. Nanoseconds atm. (30s)
      destroyTimeout:  30000000000

# static file serving.
static:
  # serve http static files
  enable:  true

  # root directory for static file (http would not serve .php and .htaccess files).
  dir:   "public"

  # list of extensions to forbid for serving.
  forbid: [".php", ".htaccess"]
```

> You can use json or any config type supported by `spf13/viper`.

Where `psr-worker.php`:

```php
ini_set('display_errors', 'stderr');

$relay = new Spiral\Goridge\StreamRelay(STDIN, STDOUT);
$psr7 = new Spiral\RoadRunner\PSR7Client(new Spiral\RoadRunner\Worker($relay));

while ($req = $psr7->acceptRequest()) {
    try {
        $resp = new \Zend\Diactoros\Response()
        $resp->getBody()->write("hello world");

        $psr7->respond($resp);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        $psr7->getWorker()->error((string)$e);
    }
}
```

> Check how to init relay [here](./php-src/tests/client.php).

Working with RoadRunner service:
--------

RoadRunner application can be started by calling simple command from the root of your PHP application.

```
$ rr serve -v
```

You can also run RR in debug mode to view all incoming requests.

```
$ rr serve -d -v
```

You can force RR service to reload it's http workers.

```
$ rr http:reset
```

> You can attach this command as file watcher in your IDE.

To view status of all active workers in interactive mode.

```
$ rr http:workers -i
```

```

Writing Services:
--------
RoadRunner uses service bus to organize it's internal services and their depencies, this approach is similar to PHP Container implementation. You can create your own services, event listeners, middlewares and etc.

RoadRunner would not start service without a proper config section at the moment, simply add new section to .rr file.

```yaml
service:
  enable: true
  option: value
```

You can write your own config file now:

```golang
package service

type config struct {
	Enable bool
	Option string
}
```

To create the service implement interface:

```golang
// Service provides high level functionality for road runner modules.
type Service interface {
	// Init must return configure service and return true if service hasStatus enabled. Must return error in case of
	// misconfiguration. Services must not be used without proper configuration pushed first.
	Init(cfg Config, c Container) (enabled bool, err error)

	// Serve serves.
	Serve() error

	// Stop stops the service.
	Stop()
}
```

Simple service might look like:

```golang
package service

import "github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service"

const ID = "service"
type Service struct {
	cfg  *config
}

func (s *Service) Init(cfg service.Config, c service.Container) (enabled bool, err error) {
	config := &config{}
	if err := cfg.Unmarshal(config); err != nil {
		return false, err
	}

	if !config.Enable {
		return false, nil
	}

	s.cfg = config
	return true, nil
}

func (s *Service) Serve() error {
	return nil
}

func (s *Service) Stop() {
	 // nothing
}
```

Service can be added to RR bus by creating your own version of [main.go](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/blob/master/cmd/rr/main.go) file:


```golang
rr.Container.Register(service.ID, &service.Service{})
```

Your service should work now. In addition you can create your own RPC adapters which are available via commands or from PHP using Goridge:

```golang
// in Init() method
if r, ok := c.Get(rpc.ID); ok >= service.StatusConfigured {
		if h, ok := r.(*rpc.Service); ok {
			h.Register("service", &rpcServer{s})
		}
}
```

> RPC server must be written based on net/rpc rules: https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/

You can connect now to this service from PHP:

```php
// make sure to use same port as in .rr config for RPC service
$rpc = new Spiral\Goridge\RPC(new Spiral\Goridge\SocketRelay('localhost', 6001));

print_r($rpc->call('service.Method', $ars));
```

HTTP service provides it's own methods as well:

```php
print_r($rpc->call('http.Workers', true));
//print_r($rpc->call('http.Reset', true));
```

You can register http middleware or event listener using such approach:

```golang
import (
  rrttp "github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service/http"
)

//...

if h, ok := c.Get(rrttp.ID); ok >= service.StatusConfigured {
		if h, ok := h.(*rrttp.Service); ok {
			h.AddMiddleware(s.middleware)
      			h.AddListener(s.middleware)
		}
	}
```

Standalone Usage:
--------
You can also use RoadRunner as library in order to drive your application without any additional protocol at top of it.

```go
srv := NewServer(
    &ServerConfig{
        Command: "php client.php echo pipes",
        Relay:   "pipes",
        Pool: &Config{
            NumWorkers:      int64(runtime.NumCPU()),
            AllocateTimeout: time.Second,
            DestroyTimeout:  time.Second,
        },
    })
defer srv.Stop()

srv.Start()

res, err := srv.Exec(&Payload{Body: []byte("hello")})
```

```php
<?php
/**
 * @var Goridge\RelayInterface $relay
 */

use Spiral\Goridge;
use Spiral\RoadRunner;

ini_set('display_errors', 'stderr');

$rr = new RoadRunner\Worker($relay);

while ($body = $rr->receive($context)) {
    try {
        $rr->send((string)$body, (string)$context);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        $rr->error((string)$e);
    }
}
```
