Imageboard/booru downloader which can download thousands of images from multiple boorus very easily.

Thanks to its powerful naming features, you just have to set your filename and save directory using all the tokens available, and the program will generate a filename using the image's information. With this, you can store and manage your pictures in advanced directory structures, and save image with custom filenames!

Grabber works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is available in English, French, Russian, simplified Chinese, and Spanish.
