# Win Application Framework (WAF)
#### Successor of the WPF Application Framework

The Win Application Framework (WAF) is a lightweight Framework that helps you to create well-structured XAML Applications in WPF and UWP. It supports you in applying various architectural patterns:
* [Layered Architecture](https://github.com/jbe2277/waf/wiki/Layered-Architecture)
* [Modular Architecture](https://github.com/jbe2277/waf/wiki/Modular-Architecture)
* [Model-View-ViewModel pattern](https://github.com/jbe2277/waf/wiki/Model-View-ViewModel-Pattern)

**How to get started?**
* WAF comes with realistic real-world sample applications. Please have a look at them. See Sample Applications below.
* The [Wiki](https://github.com/jbe2277/waf/wiki) provides further guidance.
* The fastest way to create a WAF project is by using the [WAF Visual Studio Project Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbe2277.WAFProjectTemplate). Please update the WAF NuGet packages to the latest stable version after project creation.

## Version 4

Starting with version 4 the framework comes with the new name Win Application Framework instead of WPF Application Framework. This rename shows that the framework supports now various application types:
-	WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
-	UWP (Universal Windows Platform)
-	Core (Basic support for all .NET based applications)

## Previous versions

Older versions of WAF 1.0 - 3.2 can be found at CodePlex: http://waf.codeplex.com
